#CONParser

CON (Crooked Object Notation) is a means of storing complex data structures in a plain text file in a manner that is 
human readable and intuitive.

The file starts with describing the data structures that will be used with each layer indented by tabs. Then this data 
structure is populated with data, with each item on a seperate line and lines indented depending on depth in the 
structure.
